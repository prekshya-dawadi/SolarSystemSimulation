# 3D Solar System Simulation

## Overview

This project presents a 3D Solar System Simulation developed using Python, Pygame, and OpenGL. The simulation offers an immersive educational experience, allowing users to explore the solar system, observe planetary movements, and learn about the unique characteristics of each celestial object.

## Features

- Real-time 3D representation of the solar system
- Planets with accurate sizes, distances, and movements
- High-quality textures for a lifelike appearance
- Milky Way background with randomly placed stars
- Interactive exploration and learning platform
- Innovative use of Pygame and OpenGL libraries

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Pygame library
- OpenGL library
- PIL (Pillow) library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3D-Solar-System-Simulation.git
   cd 3D-Solar-System-Simulation
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the simulation:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- Explore the solar system using mouse interactions.
- Observe realistic planetary movements and rotations.
- Learn about each celestial body's characteristics and distances.
